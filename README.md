In response to the task assigned by the School of Ethical Hacking and Cybersecurity, I developed a Secure Password Manager application, aimed at providing a robust and secure solution for managing user credentials. This application, crafted with C++, not only emphasizes the importance of cybersecurity but also implements it through advanced encryption techniques, ensuring the safe storage and retrieval of passwords. In designing this application, I meticulously adhered to the principles of algorithm efficiency, evaluating and implementing the most appropriate patterns and paradigms to meet the specific needs of secure password management. The application features a user-friendly interface for registering and validating users, along with the capability to generate strong passwords, thereby enhancing user convenience and security. Through rigorous testing and thoughtful code organization, this project not only meets the academic requirements but also serves as a practical tool for anyone looking to safeguard their digital identity. This endeavor reflects a comprehensive understanding of the key concepts of Programming and Algorithms, demonstrating a practical application of theoretical knowledge in a real-world scenario.
